# Use DevKit with Cursor

This guide walks you through setting up and using [**DevKit**](../REAME.md) with **Cursor** to quickly start a Python project.

1. Download and install the Cursor editor from the official website, then sign in to your account.

2. Install DevKit, then run the `start.bat` script to initialize the environment.

3. Create a new project directory, for example
```bat
mkdir D:\projects\hello-python
```

4. Navigate to your project folder and open it with Cursor
```bat
cd D:\projects\hello-python
cursor .
```

5. Once the Cursor editor opens (with the compiler ready), you can ask Cursor to create a new Python project. For example, type in the chat: `"Create a Hello World project in Python"`.

7. You can run your Python file directly from the Cursor terminal, or DevKit terminal: `python <file_name>.py`. Or simply ask Cursor to execute it `"Run the project"`.
